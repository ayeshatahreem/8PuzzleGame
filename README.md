# 8PuzzleGame
A 3x3 sliding puzzle android app. 

Puzzle has 8 tiles numbered 1 â€“ 8, initially shuffled and organized randomly. While space for one tile is blank. Ordering of tiles can be changed by moving the adjacent tiles to the blank space. Goal of the game is to organize tiles in ascending order when read in the left to right and top to bottom order as illustrated in figure.

While generating 8-puzzle, it has also been checked if the game is solvable by following a good tutorial available on University of Birmingham's web page on Solvability of the Tiles Game (https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mdr/teaching/modules04/java2/TilesSolvability.html).
